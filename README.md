[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats-git-masterrstaa-rickstaa.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=sg-hk&theme=dracula)](https://github.com/sg-hk/github-readme-stats)

i want to learn more about coding by applying the (very little) i know to issues i have
for example:
- pytimer, a pomodoro timer based on tatsumato but using hyprland commands.[Note: to be changed to river commands, my current wm]
- ccq, a sort of very lightweight flashcard app + Chinese parser & dictionary. [Note: very early stage]
