i want to learn more about coding by applying the (very little) i know to issues i have
for example:
- ccq, lightweight flashcard app in C [Note: currently not working]
- ctimer, a pomodoro timer in C. Very barebones. Wayland (compositor) / river (wm) / creek (status bar) / tiramisu (notification manager) specific functionalities to be added later

old:
- pytimer, a pomodoro timer in Python adapted for the hyprland environment. More functionalities than ctimer; but I don't use hyprland now
