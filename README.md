[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats-git-masterrstaa-rickstaa.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=sg-hk&theme=dracula)](https://github.com/sg-hk/github-readme-stats)

i want to learn more about coding by applying the (very little) i know to issues i have
for example:
- pytimer, a pomodoro timer based on tatsumato but which fits my environment (hyprland)
- ccq, a much more lightweight and pure version of a python bloatmaxx'd flashcard app i use every day. [IN THE WORKS]
- ccq-mine, reworking mpvacious and immersive (two mpv scripts) to fit my needs [DISTANTLY IN THE WORKS]
