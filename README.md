i want to learn more about coding by applying the (very little) i know to issues i have
for example:
- ccq, lightweight flashcard app in C. Very barebones, half-working
- ctimer, a pomodoro timer in C. Very barebones, but working

old:
- pytimer, a pomodoro timer in Python adapted for the hyprland environment. More functionalities than ctimer (focus app, lock screen, etc.); but depends on hyprland
